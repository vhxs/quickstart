# Test website

## This is a website generated by Hugo, using a hack of the XMin template

I'm learning how to use static site generators because I want to blog more regularly. I want use a modern blog stack and would rather avoid writing plain HTML so that I can more easily future-proof the content that I write. This post itself is naturally going to be unpolished because a polished post here is not the goal.

This site uses Hugo to generate content. I'm taking the [XMin](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-xmin/) theme and modifying it so that it's more representative of me and my tastes.

I like the minimality of the original theme and I hope to keep it minimal. One common trait of the blogs that I like are their minimality. I'd rather avoid theming that looks too clickbaity. I really don't want my blog posts looking like Medium articles. However, I'd like to change things like colors, fonts, and layout.

Here's some math. Knowing me, chances are that I'm going to want to write some math. This theme uses KaTeX. I deliberately looked for a theme that uses KaTeX instead of MathJax because KaTeX is supposed to render faster.

$$e^{i \pi} = -1$$

Here's some Python code:

```python
def factorial(x):
  if x < 0: raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative integers.")
  if not isinstance(x, int): raise ValueError("x needs to be an integer. This isn't the Gamma function.")
  return 1 if x == 0 else x * factorial(x-1)
```
